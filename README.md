## API & Authentication

- The app communicates with a remote movies API hosted under `https://apis.ccbp.in/movies-app`.
- Authentication uses a JWT stored in a cookie named `jwt_token`.
- Protected routes are implemented using a custom `ProtectedRoute` component that checks for a valid token before rendering the page.

> If you are using this as part of a course or assignment, refer to the corresponding documentation for valid login credentials and any API restrictions.
